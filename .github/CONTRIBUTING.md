1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cdonnachie/kylacoin-stratum-proxy.git
   cd kylacoin-stratum-proxy
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure your environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. **Run the proxy**

   python -m kcn_proxy.main
   ```

### Using Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

Before creating a bug report, please check the existing issues to see if the problem has already been reported. When creating a bug report, include:

- **Descriptive title** - Clearly describe the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** - Exact steps to reproduce the problem
- **Expected behavior** - What you expected to happen
- **Actual behavior** - What actually happened
- **Environment** - OS, Python version, Docker version, etc.
- **Logs** - Relevant error messages or logs
- **Screenshots** - If applicable

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! Please include:

- **Clear description** - What you want to add and why
- **Use cases** - How this feature would be useful
- **Possible implementation** - Any suggestions on how to implement it (optional)

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

- Feature: `feature/short-description`
- Bug fix: `bugfix/short-description`
- Documentation: `docs/short-description`

Example: `feature/add-worker-filter` or `bugfix/fix-api-route-matching`

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add filter status indicator to shares dashboard

- Display active filters as individual badges
- Allow clearing individual filters
- Disable search field when specific worker selected
- Add animations for filter badge appearance
```

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized

### Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Syntax check** - Verify your Python code compiles
   ```bash
   python -m py_compile kcn_proxy/your_file.py
   ```

2. **Manual testing** - Test your changes thoroughly
   - For UI changes: Test in both dark and light modes
   - For API changes: Test affected endpoints
   - For database changes: Verify data integrity

3. **Browser compatibility** - Test UI changes in modern browsers

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and commit with clear messages

3. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Provide a clear title and description
   - Reference related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - Describe what you changed and why
   - Include any relevant testing information

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused - one feature/fix per PR
- Update documentation if needed
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test across different browsers for UI changes
- Ensure all code follows the style guidelines

## Key Areas for Contribution

- **Bug fixes** - Help us squash bugs!
- **UI/UX improvements** - Enhance the dashboard
- **Performance** - Optimize database queries and API calls
- **Documentation** - Improve README, guides, and comments
- **Testing** - Add validation scenarios
- **Features** - New capabilities like additional metrics or notifications

## Performance and Security Considerations

### Performance

- Minimize database queries - use JOINs when appropriate
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks

### Security

- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Keep dependencies updated
- Report security issues privately (see SECURITY.md)

## Questions?

- Check existing issues and discussions
- Review the documentation in README.md and DASHBOARD.md
- Open a discussion for general questions
