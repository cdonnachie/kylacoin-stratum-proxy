# Suppress B104 (hardcoded_bind_all_interfaces)
# 0.0.0.0 is intentional for server services (stratum proxy, dashboard)
# These are server-side network services, not client connections
# Binding to all interfaces is the correct behavior for public-facing services
#
# Suppress B311 (blacklist_random)
# Used only for backoff jitter timing, not cryptographic purposes
# Safe for non-security use cases
